We all have two lives. The second one starts when we realize we only have one. - Tom Hiddleston

It hurts to know you'll never remember the things I'll never forget.

We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give. - Winston Churchill

Open your mouth only if what you are going to say is more beautiful than silence.

Never get so busy making a living that you forget to make a life.

Forget what hurt you in the past. But never forget what it taught you.
